Further Information on How We Process Face Data</strong></p><p>Allowing its Users to compare any face with the celebrities and find out which celebrity they look like, My Replica – Celebrity Like Me inevitably requires face data to make such comparisons. In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device’s camera and/or photos already stored in your device. This access can be toggled on or off at any time in your device’s settings.</p><p>In doing so, we use a third-party algorithm offered by Amazon Rekognition. The method detects the faces in the image provided by Users and extracts facial features into a feature vector. Later, extracted feature vectors are used to perform face match.</p><p>The camera images and resulting data (feature vectors) are only used for the purposes of comparison. Once a session is complete we do not retain any of this facial data. Facial data is never stored to a disk. We do not perform facial recognition on your facial data.</p><p>The app does not sync face data to a server or cloud. It is only transferred to and processed by Amazon Rekognition to obtain feature vectors from the face data provided and search celebrities collection for matching faces.</p><p><strong>IV. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p>We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We will not rent or sell your personal data to third parties, but we may share your information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App. We do not control or influence these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p><p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.
